This is a fork of ARDOP I keep just for reference.

For me (Debian 12 x86_64 bits) just ARDOPC and ARDOPOFDM compile.

--

Copy boards.txt and platform.txt to hardware\teensy\avr in your Arduino IDE installation folder.

Set Sketchbook location (File/Preferences Menu) to the location of TeensyProjects, eg

C:\OneDrive\Dev\Source\TeensyProjects

If you want to compile the Soundcard Emulation sketches see TeensyProjects\libraries\SoundCard\README.txt
